       "  'selftext': 'Greetings!,\\n\\nDoes social distancing affect how time is passing for us and our daily lives? To help us investigate (and eventually help people in future), please participate in this global online study which is being done in more than 15 countries! Become part of a global effort of 17 time perception labs across the world! (Anyone above 18 years of age can participate.). Use a laptop or desktop to do the study.\\n\\nhttps://brainthemind.com/time-social-distance/ Please click on the India link at the bottom of the page, if you are currently staying in India.\\n\\nIt is a longitudinal study with 3 sessions or runs spread in time (over weeks and months). That is you need to do this THREE times in total, once immediately, the second time after 10 days and the third time after 3 months. Please carefully go through Help &amp; Support: https://brainthemind.com/time-social-distancing-en/ ). \\n\\nEach run takes a fair amount of time, which would take around 5-6 hours (max). Each session or run consists of many questionnaires and experimental tasks, some of which would be repeated to get a reliable estimate. For the first session, you can pace yourself and spread it across five to seven days. So, please invest at least 30-40 minutes each day in order to complete the study. There are no correct or wrong answers and do your best to answer questions or respond to what is shown or played in the computer. We suggest you to not try to complete it in one day itself (spread it over at least 2-3 days) so that you do not tire yourself or get bored quickly. \\n\\nSpread it among people you know. We have a large target and we want to collect as much data from India as possible. Time is ticking :)\\n\\nThank you! (For support email @ timesocialdistancing.in@gmail.com )',\n",

For many in this sub owning a business is the deciding factor to a genuine question or a spoiled brat's complaints. but please hear me out on this.\\n\\nWhat will the future hold for people in the lower-income middle-class bracket? Many small business owners are weekly earners (if that's a thing), they have bills, rents and EMI's to pay. Many have workers depending on them. \\n\\nIf the lockdown is extended further as many suggest what will the future hold for these guys? They might have already exhausted their savings. \\n\\nI think we might see an increase in the rate of EMI defaulters, an increase in poverty and a cascading effect on all major economic sectors.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \" In general, starting a business in itself is a challenge. As a consumer I would probably be happy buying on discount from ecommerce, but as a human I feel very sad for local electronics shops and stores.   \\n\\n\\nSay, someone opts for dealership of Dell, he would have competition in market because of HP, Lenevo store and so on. Fine till now. Then there would be local shops selling multiple brands. Again fine till now. But then online giants come and sell the same product at huge discount and as consumer even I get excited seeing this but deep down I always know this will ruin the traditional brick and mortar shops. I don't have anyone in my family into electronics business but I feel sad for those who are into this. I can't even imagine about those who actually have to deal with this and how they are dealing during this crisis and how would they deal after it.  \\n\\n\\nI just picked up an example of laptop brands but this applies on all electronics items. But comparatively in India, laptop buyers are usually literate enough to order online.\",\n",

People seemed to be more interested and invested in what religion the assailants were a part of rather than the fact that people were taking the law into their own hands. I have seen this many times on Twitter, when it comes to some sort of crime or injustice, the first question people would ask on Twitter or try to find out is \"What religion do they believe in?\". I don\\'t use Twitter that often but when I do check it, something of this sort is always trending. It baffles me that people could actually be *this* braindead. Everything is about religion now, and its sad.',\n",

But this has only furthered their image and has strengthened their resolve to spew more and more venom on the country...\\n\\nIsn't it high time to rather focus our time spent in social media to rather exposing the misdeeds on economical front..? It may not sound appealing, and it's slow... But as a matter of fact it is lot more effective... Remember how much of a problem Rafael was..? Alas, they soon turned it into nationalism (remember Pulwama..?) and we forgot everything about questioning Rafael...\\n\\nSo let's focus of Economic exposures of this govt, and only then it's control can truly come to the hands of the people as our constitution makers had envisaged...\\n\\nWe can't expect media to do the job, we need to crowd source it by pooling our own individual talent... Shouldn't we.?\\n\\nWhat say..?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'West Bengal govt. has proved itself to be incompetent in controlling the pandemic in the state in every possible way.\\n\\nIt has regularly tried to protest center involvement, when they didn\\'t comply with the IMCT teams just because the state govt. was not \"informed\" beforehand. Only after Ajay Bhalla, Home Secretary sent a notice to the chief secretary of state, did the state govt. agree to cooperate. ([Notice](https://imgur.com/a/9jxmCY3))\\n\\nNow, The chief secretary of state banned use of mobile phone in hospitals just after a video (from inside of a hospital in Kolkata) was shared by Babul Supriyo. ([Video](https://twitter.com/SuPriyoBabul/status/1252211460941340672?s=20))\\n\\nNow, for some stats,ONLY **415, 424** &amp; **713** samples were tested on the last three days. \\n\\nInfection rate among the tested can be averaged to almost **6.18%** i.e out of 100 people tested, almost 6 to 7 persons test positive. And we must not forget these **6k** tests have been done in a state of **91 million** people. \\n\\nMamata Banerjee\\'s govt. is putting its people in a great deal of risk and if It doesn\\'t start taking some serious action instead of throwing blames on the central govt, We might really be sitting on a coronavirus time bomb ([reference](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/bengal-sitting-coronavirus-time-bomb)).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSome other reltd articles.:\\n\\n* Chief Secretary of state says \"outsiders can\\'t guide us\". (referring to the teams sent by center to assess the situation in bengal) ([https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/coronavirus-outbreak-outsiders-cant-guide-us-says-rajiva-sinha/cid/1767002](https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/coronavirus-outbreak-outsiders-cant-guide-us-says-rajiva-sinha/cid/1767002)) \\n* Also, another tweet by Babul Supriyo alleging the person who shot the above video was arrested after he was released from hospital today.(https://twitter.com/SuPriyoBabul/status/1252828771826065410?s=20)\\n\\n\\\\#stay\\\\_home\\n\\n\\\\#stay\\\\_safe',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So my girlfriend is Indian and she and I live in the  same city. Due to Covid19, she is unable to travel out of state to visit her family. She got home last night and was frustrated. She said she was feeling “white washed” and was missing home and the culture that comes with being home (speaking Hindi with her family, Indian food, etc). \\n\\nSo basically I want to do something for her to make her feel connected to her culture even when she can’t be with her family. Something like cook a vegetarian Indian meal and surprise her with it, maybe have some traditional or popular music playing as she comes home while I’m cooking it. Maybe pair the dinner with a Bollywood movie? (She watched one of her favorites last night to feel better). \\n\\nI would love any and all suggestions/help. And again, please let me know where to post this if there is a more appropriate sub. \\n\\nThanks',\n",

End of Sentence.” (Short Film): Director Rayka Zehtabchi tells the story of women in a rural village outside Delhi, India, who learn to manufacture and market their own sanitary pads.\\n\\nAbout the film: https://www.news18.com/news/movies/period-end-of-sentence-review-this-netflix-documentary-is-aspirational-in-principle-impactful-in-general-2034769.html\\n\\n&gt; Rayka Zehtabchi’s short directorial is aimed at unwrapping stigma, fear, insecurity, ignorance and bad education, inherent in a woman’s life. Her tool--a humble looking sanitary pad. The film opens inside a room, two girls in their adolescent years, shying away when asked to talk about menstruation. \\n\\n&gt; As is revealed, we all know of it but we don’t talk about it. “Menstruation is the biggest taboo in India”, points out Arunachalam Murauganantham, the social activist from Coimbatore, who is leading the crusade of making India into a 100 per cent sanitary napkin using country.\\n\\n&gt; We meet characters that champion the filmmaker’s cause. We are introduced to Sneha, Rekha, Shabana and other unnamed heroes of the film that are entrepreneurial, self-sufficient, smart and empathetic. Here, they are not dealing with issues limited only to their village, but are shouting out at the ones that are much bigger than them.\\n\\n-\\n\\n**Link to the film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrm2pD0qofM**',\n",

IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   \\n\\n\\n**Background on AFRS**\\n\\nThe RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  \\n\\n\\n1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,\\n2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),\\n3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,\\n4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,\\n5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA\\n6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  \\n\\n\\nThe NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)). \\xa0However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB. \\xa0According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  \\n\\n\\nAs pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   \\n\\n\\n**Steps taken by IFF**  \\n\\n\\nIFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.\\n\\nIn this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  \\n\\n\\n1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.\\n2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology\\n3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.\\n4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  \\n\\n\\n**What’s Next?**\\n\\nIFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.   \\n\\n\\n**Important Documents**\\n\\n1.

       "  'selftext': \"There were many indian idea that were stolen by the West and covered up. \\nLike the Transedental Meditation of Mahirshi Yogi was plagiarized by Dr. Herbert Benson( learned about him through his book relaxation response). He firstly learnt it from him then re-constructed it, gave it name of Relaxation Response , what he did was that he changed the mantra from Aum, Aum, Aum to One, One, one and he's considered the pioneer of meditation. \\n And then there's a guy name Jon kabat zinn credited as the pioneer of Mindfulness Meditation but it is Vipassana. He learned it from Mahirshi Goinka and then put it into medical use found that it worked but didn't gave any credit to the Mahirshi. \\n\\nWilliam James at Harvard, who hosted Vivekananda , is considered as the poineer of modern psychology but lot of his ideas were picked from Vivekananda and Buddhism. \\n\\nThe idea of organic farming was taken from India. A british guy named Sir Albert Howard 100 years back came to India to teach farmers modern agriculture but he had said in his book that I actually learned from them. He learned organic farming and set up big farming labs in Britain and ended up becoming up a famous man. Then a man named Rudolf Steiner came to India, he learned all of this and wrote many books about Vedas, Mandala et cetera but due to his rivalry with Krishnamurthy ( who was elected as the head of their political group) , he re-constructed all this information and gave his name to it and today he is considered as the father of organic farming. \\n\\nTheir theory is simple when they learn something they acknowledge their gurus, they show tremendous respect towards our culture and sanskriti . They show that they are deciphers of swamis etc. \\n\\nBut when they become confident and have some knowledge about it then they try to plagiarize and market it. They deconstruct it, they remove the Guru, the Shashtras, Indian culture etc and make it kind of universal. Universal knowledge that doesn't belong to anyone. Many ideas from our Dharma are characterized as spiritual but not religious. \\n\\nThen they make the ideas of their own, they re-construct the ideas like Christian Yoga, Christian Bharatnatyam( they do change their name) etc.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Three years ago I (25m) traveled to India to backpack for a month. I stayed in Rishikesh for about two weeks. One day I was walking down the street when I was approached by a young guy ~18. He offered me a smoke and a coffee and invited me over to chat, it seemed genuine, they didn’t try to sell me anything. I was introduced to another guy &gt;25 and we all chatted and had a smoke. He asked me about my travel plans and offered travel advice, which I was seeking because I was planning my next move. In fact they had a travel agency, which was next door, but closed at the time and could help me arrange my flights. It seemed legit because there was actually a travel agency next door and I was in a legitimate storefront. So we planned a few flights from the nearby airport to Kashmir&gt;Dharamshala&gt;Delhi. So I gave them the \"deposit\" of ~$50. They then proceeded to invite me over for dinner and gave me a ride back to my place.\\n\\n Later that night I was talking to my airbnb host and told him my plans. He tells me I know those f***ers! He tells me, go ahead and go to dinner; have fun, the food will be good, they will get drunk, argue, and offer you some gems. He told me the first plane ticket will work but then you will be stranded and it won’t be worth the time and money to come back to get the guys. \\n\\nSo with this information I ride my scooter to the apartment to meet them. After debating going straight militant and kicking the door in, I enter and try to act normal. I greeted the two guys from before 18m, 26m and their friend, 22m charismatic , who had invited a couple of girls that he had met. A girl from Michigan, cute, young, and another foreigner I can’t remember her origins, but they are both cute. Anyway, we all cook together, like one person peeled the garlic and another chopped the onions. I didn’t help because I was a little on edge. I’m sitting there thinking, this is all for me, to scam me. The girls, the food, friendliness. I remember noticing how the guy wasn’t very interested in the girls, he had something else on his mind. The girls were there for me.  The food was really good. Then they offered me some whiskey and tried to pressure me into drinking. I firmly declined. The night went on a little bit and the girls had to go. At this point the 26m was getting kinda drunk and started arguing with the other guy. \\n\\nNow it was time to talk business. He asked me if I would take some precious gems to the USA and he would give me money but something about a deposit. I snapped. I got up and said give me my money right now you mother fucker. He begged prayer hands “my friend, my friend calm down, my friend, you miss understood” I positioned myself so that my back was to the door. There are two scrawny Indians near me and the third in the kitchen(possible knife situation). I figure if I act violently enough I could probably fuck them all up. I grabbed the 26m by the collar and yoke him up and demanded my money. He says he doesn’t have the money right now and to come to the store tomorrow. I leave the situation and head back to my apartment. Everything my airbnb host predicted came true. One of my biggest regrets in life is not smacking the fuck outa that scammer. It\\'s rare that we get the chance to be so close to such scumbags. \\n\\n\\nThe next day I go to the storefront and the guy wants to talk, I won’t hear a word of it until I get my money. Finally he gave me my money and I am willing to hear a word. He says “ I never offered you any money” and I just say F**k you and walk out. \\ntdlr Went to Rishikesh and almost got scammed.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi All,\\n\\nIn the last few days, me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors. We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats.\\n\\nWe were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. \\n\\nWe now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.\\n\\nThe animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right. Did I ensure that the animal will have a new lease of life or only bought it some time?',\n",

In any other time, I'd be astronomically excited to join the college and persue my degree.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nBut situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nWhat would be your suggestion for me. I have to make the initial payment by the 24th.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '  \\n\\nHey Everyone,\\n\\nI am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic\\n\\nNote : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include\\n\\n**TLDR**\\n\\n1. Beard Trimmer -\\n\\nEconomy Segment - [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Price - Rs.1349 . &amp; [Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Price - Rs.1199\\n\\nPremium Segment - [Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \\\\- Price -Rs.1999\\n\\n2. Full Body Grooming Kits -\\n\\nEconomy Segment - [Beardo Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) Price Rs.1299\\n\\nPremium Segment - [Nova 1153 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3)\\\\- Price Rs.1599\\n\\n3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home\\n\\n[Nova Hair Clipper](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) Price Rs 1295\\n\\n**Detailed Analysis**\\n\\n**Beard Trimmer**\\n\\n**Economy Segment**\\n\\n[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349\\n\\nSpec Wise &amp; Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings &amp; IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time &amp; 11 length settings\\n\\nProduct quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched\\n\\nDecision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi\\n\\n**Premium Segment**\\n\\n[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \\\\- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.\\n\\nSpecs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition\\n\\n**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**\\n\\nPhilips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits\\n\\n**Economy Segment**\\n\\n[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \\\\- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299\\n\\nDecent Specs : 45 min run time &amp; 21 Length settings\\n\\n5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb\\n\\nNo competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great\\n\\n**Premium Segment**\\n\\n[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599\\n\\nSimilar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones\\n\\nMy Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052\\n\\n**Hair Clippers**\\n\\nMost of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now\\n\\n[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \\\\- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good\\n\\nHopefully the information turns out to be useful. If you want to know anything else just drop a comment',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Indian Parents, its lock-down season now and we know that there\\'s something terribly wrong with Indian education system. I have a proposal I would like to put up for validation, so some of us may be familiar with the term \"Socratic method\", for those who are not, it is the way of teaching where you induce curiosity into the pupil\\'s mind, it works on the assumption that all knowledge is innate within us and just requires to be brought out. I have been an avid practitioner and long time beneficiary of this technique. It has not only helped me learn the oddest of concepts (I am a law student, I have to study a lot of odd bizarre topics) but teach them with success as well. Basically it\\'s all about leading the child in right direction of thought, it\\'s about teaching the student how to think instead of what to think. In my opinion, this allows for greater actual learning and less rote learning. I was thinking about it and thought about having some insight from Indian parents and students before going ahead and taking on the challenge to build a platform to facilitate this.   \\nWould you want something like this?   \\nHow do you think this should be executed to best help your needs and requirements?',\n",

She is on a tourist visa which is only valid for 90 days and is due to expire in the first week of May. We tried contacting the NZ embassy and got told to contact the nearest FRRO in India. I applied for a visa extension but they closed the file and stated that I have to apply for extension only two days before her visa is to expire. Is this even safe? What happens if they refuse to extend the visa etc? I don’t understand this process. If anyone is or has been in a similar situation, please help. We have tried calling the Indian Embassy and also the FRRO office and no one actually gives any answer.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Looking for advice - Hi guys, my grandma is an NZ citizen and she is stuck in India right now. She is on a tourist visa which is only valid for 90 days and is due to expire in the first week of May. We tried contacting the NZ embassy and got told to contact the nearest FRRO in India. I applied for a visa extension but they closed the file and stated that I have to apply for extension only two days before her visa is to expire. Is this even safe? What happens if they refuse to extend the visa etc? I don’t understand this process. If anyone is or has been in a similar situation, please help. We have tried calling the Indian Embassy and also the FRRO office and no one actually gives any answer.',\n",

Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.\\nThe Flag bearer against Mughal shahi were Marathas who were a farmer caste in Maharashtra and definitely they were not Kshatriyas.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hi /r/india,\\n\\nI need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. \\n\\nYesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me about how someone else could register my number for their Aadhar.\\n\\nToday, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request going on for my account and that I needn't worry. On the myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.\\n\\nBut I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.\\n\\nIs there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?\\n\\nAny help is appreciated guys, thanks!\\n\\nP.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access.\",\n",
